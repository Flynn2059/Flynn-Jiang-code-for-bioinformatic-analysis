# Introduction
* This repository contains code that I have personally used in bioinformatics analysis.
* Code is written in both R and Python. I may also upload shell commands.
* Feel free to use my code if it serves your purpose.
* I hope you’ll learn about my work and capabilities through this repository. For my CV and more personal information, please visit my website: [flynn2059.top](http://www.flynn2059.top)

# About code comments
* Code comments are written in either Simplified Chinese or English, depending on the project and the working language of collaborators. I have no personal preference for either language.
* Please don’t open issues about comment language. If you struggle to understand a piece of code, try using translation tools or LLMs — or just message me!
